**Policy enforcement**

<details>

<summary><strong>🇧🇷 Brazil - Speed benchmark compliance and outcome-based ISP funding</strong></summary>

**Context:** Brazil's _Estratégia Nacional de Escolas Conectadas_ (ENEC) sets a target of 1 Mbps per enrolled student in the longest school shift. With hundreds of thousands of schools, manual compliance verification is not feasible.

**Use case:** Real-time SIMET data (analogous to Giga Meter) allows the Ministry of Communications (MCom) to monitor which schools meet the benchmark continuously, not only at contract signing. The same data validates ISP performance under the FUST Fiscal Benefit, which lets ISPs fulfil their Universal Service Fund obligations by delivering measured high-speed connectivity to schools rather than paying into a central fund.

**Decision triggered:** Schools below the per-student threshold are flagged for ISP follow-up. ISP fiscal benefit claims are accepted only when validated against live measurement data.

**What makes this model work:** The benchmark is school-specific: it scales with enrolment rather than being a fixed Mbps number. That makes it harder for ISPs to meet the letter of the contract while underserving larger schools.

<summary><strong>🇧🇼 Botswana - Village Connectivity Project monitoring</strong></summary>

**Context:** Botswana's Village Connectivity Project aims to connect schools to a 100 Mbps standard. With around 700 schools connected, the government needed a way to verify that the standard was being met in practice, not only on paper.

**Use case:** Giga Meter is deployed alongside UNICEF's Learning Passport, a digital content platform that gives students access to curriculum materials offline and online. The two programmes are co-deployed: Giga Meter data feeds into the government's SmartBots monitoring initiative to assess whether schools meet the 100 Mbps benchmark, while Learning Passport depends on that connectivity being real and sustained. Connectivity monitoring here is not only about ISP compliance; it is a prerequisite for digital content delivery reaching students.

The model is being extended beyond schools to health centres and community facilities, with connectivity infrastructure shared across sectors to improve affordability.

**Deployment model:** Remote, centralised support team. Schools install Giga Meter independently following the installation guide, with a government-run support desk for troubleshooting.

**Decision triggered:** Schools consistently below 100 Mbps are identified for ISP renegotiation or infrastructure upgrade planning. Learning Passport rollout is sequenced against connectivity verification; schools without confirmed connectivity are not activated for content delivery.

<summary><strong>🇲🇳 Mongolia - LAN triangulation and decentralised ISP contracting</strong></summary>

**Context:** Mongolia's Education Information Technology Centre (EITC) monitors internet performance in schools via LibreNMS on routers and access points alongside Giga Meter on user devices. The data is triangulated to identify whether connectivity problems sit at the ISP level, the router, or the local access point.

**Use case:** Giga Meter provides the end-device measurement layer that infrastructure-side tools (LibreNMS) cannot. Together, the data is used to troubleshoot and improve quality of experience for end users, including students and teachers.

Mongolia is also moving to decentralised connectivity contracting, allowing schools to contract ISPs directly within standardised Service Level Agreements. Giga Meter data provides the evidence base for schools and regional coordinators to compare user experience against the ISP's contract level.

**Decision triggered:** Schools with poor end-device performance despite healthy router metrics are flagged for ISP-side investigation. Contract renewal decisions are informed by school-level measurement history.

**Digital education programming**

<details>

<summary><strong>🇫🇯 Fiji - Identifying schools ready for live STEM broadcast lessons</strong></summary>

**Context:** Fiji faces a shortage of qualified STEM teachers in its remote island communities. The Ministry of Education developed a programme to broadcast live STEM lessons to multiple schools at once, which works only for schools with reliable, stable connectivity.

**Use case:** Giga Meter data identifies which schools have connectivity stable enough to support live broadcast lessons. A school that frequently drops or shows high variability cannot reliably participate. The data makes the selection process evidence-based rather than reliant on school self-reporting or ISP claims.

**Decision triggered:** Only schools with confirmed reliable connectivity over a monitoring period are enrolled in the live lesson programme. Schools below threshold are flagged for infrastructure support before enrolment.

<summary><strong>🇧🇦 Bosnia and Herzegovina - Meaningful connectivity screening</strong></summary>

**Context:** A digital education programme needed to identify which schools met a "meaningful connectivity" threshold before deploying content and devices.

**Use case:** Giga Meter data was used to screen schools against the meaningful connectivity benchmark, a composite threshold that considers download speed, upload speed, latency, and uptime together. Schools not meeting the benchmark were excluded from the initial programme cohort and flagged for connectivity support.

**Decision triggered:** School eligibility for digital education programme enrolment. Schools below threshold were routed to a separate infrastructure support workstream.

**Baseline and planning**

<details>

<summary><strong>🇱🇰 Sri Lanka - From provincial baseline to national rollout</strong></summary>

Sri Lanka had no standardised, independently verified baseline of school connectivity. National expansion of digital education programming required knowing the real state of connectivity, not survey responses or ISP records.

Giga Meter was deployed in a phased hybrid rollout, beginning with Eastern Province schools trained through regional workshops. Data from the province provided the first reliable, school-level connectivity baseline to inform national planning. More than 500 schools are now on Giga Maps. Nationwide, around 30% of the country's roughly 10,000 schools have internet access.

***

**The Connected Schools Model**

At the forefront of deployment in Ampara, the largest district in Sri Lanka's Eastern Province and stretching over 150 km, is **Mrs. S. R. Hasanthi**, Zonal Director of Education. She championed a model that links schools with fully equipped ICT labs to schools with fewer resources, enabling virtual classrooms that reach students regardless of location. One hub school, **Gamini Maha Vidyalaya**, now supports 20 interconnected schools.

> "Thanks to connectivity through these ICT labs, students are developing digital skills and expanding their knowledge beyond the classroom." - Mrs. S. R. Hasanthi, Zonal Director of Education, Ampara

Giga Meter's daily automated tests provided the baseline the Ministry needed: not a one-time survey, but a continuous record of school-level connectivity. The **Sip Arana web app**, developed by Ampara's own teachers, is already reaching 200 students with free worksheets. Connectivity data informs which schools can host and sustain tools like this.

> "Every school deserves access to fast, reliable internet. Every child deserves the chance to learn, to grow, to dream. Connected schools create a connected future." - Mrs. Hasanthi

**A student's perspective**

Harshani is a 10th-grade student at Bakmitiyawa Vidyalaya in rural Ampara, aspiring to become a lawyer:

> "Before our school had connectivity, I climbed trees and even went onto sheds to get stronger signals and access information. Now, with more schools getting connected, I feel hopeful that students like me can have the same opportunities as those in cities."

**Decision triggered:** Baseline data used to identify which schools can support digital programming and which require investment before rollout. Eastern Province results are informing the national expansion plan.

**Procurement and investment**

<details>

<summary><strong>🇳🇦 Namibia - Evidence for connectivity procurement</strong></summary>

**Context:** Namibia's national target is 100% of schools connected at 1 Gbps by 2030. Before negotiating large-scale connectivity contracts, the government needed verified data on current performance to anchor procurement discussions.

**Use case:** Giga Meter provides independent, school-level performance data for procurement negotiations, replacing ISP-reported figures with independently verified measurements.

**Decision triggered:** The procurement team enters negotiations with verified performance baselines, gap analysis by region, and historical trend data.
