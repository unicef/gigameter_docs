# Network Destinations & Firewall Configuration

This page is for IT administrators who need to configure firewalls, proxy servers, or content filtering systems to allow Giga Meter traffic.

{% hint style="info" %}
All Giga Meter connections use **DNS-resolvable hostnames** over **HTTPS (port 443)**. The app does not connect to hardcoded static IP addresses. A DNS-based domain whitelist is sufficient; no static IP list is required or maintained.
{% endhint %}

### Traffic characterization

#### Speed test (NDT7 protocol)

| Attribute    | Detail                                                                                         |

| Port         | 443                                                                                            |
| Direction    | Bidirectional, download: server→client; upload: client→server                                  |
| Data content | Random binary data (bulk transfer for throughput measurement)                                  |
| Duration     | \~10-15 seconds per test                                                                       |
| Frequency    | Up to 4 tests per day: 1 at device startup + 3 in random windows (8-12h, 12-16h, 16-20h local) |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Speed test traffic produces short, high-bandwidth bursts that may resemble suspicious activity in traffic monitoring systems. This is expected: the test needs to saturate the connection to measure its capacity. Each burst lasts approximately 10-15 seconds and occurs up to 4 times per day.

### M-Lab server selection

M-Lab's speed test infrastructure is a globally distributed network of servers. Giga Meter does not connect to a fixed server; it selects the nearest one at the time of each test:

1. **Discovery:** The app calls `locate.measurementlab.net` over HTTPS to request the nearest available server
2. **Selection:** The Locate Service returns the nearest NDT server as a DNS hostname (not an IP address)
3. **Test:** The app connects to the selected server via WebSocket/TLS (wss://) on port 443

Because M-Lab's server pool is dynamic, with servers regularly added, removed, and maintained, a static IP list is not feasible. The DNS wildcard `*.measurementlab.net` covers both the Locate Service and all NDT servers globally and is the correct whitelisting approach.

### Application architecture summary

| Layer            | Technology                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Frontend         | Angular 19 + Ionic 6                |
| Desktop runtime  | Electron 29                         |
| Backend          | NestJS (Node.js / TypeScript)       |
| Database         | PostgreSQL                          |
| Speed test       | NDT7 (M-Lab), Apache 2.0            |
| Cloud hosting    | Microsoft Azure                     |
| Error monitoring | Sentry (self-hosted by UNICEF ICTD) |

**Data flow:**

1. School installs app → registers with school ID → backend saves registration
2. App runs scheduled speed tests (NDT7) and ping measurements (Cloudflare)
3. Results uploaded to Giga Backend via HTTPS REST API
4. Aggregated data displayed on [Giga Maps](https://maps.giga.global/) (public)
5. Offline resilience: if the network is unavailable, measurements are stored locally and synced when connectivity returns (up to 7 days of offline storage)
