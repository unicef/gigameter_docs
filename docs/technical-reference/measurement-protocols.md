# Measurement Protocols

Giga Meter uses two types of tests to assess internet quality at schools: a **Speed Test** and a **Ping Test**.

---

## Speed Test

Powered by the **NDT-7 protocol** developed, maintained, and hosted by [Measurement Lab (M-Lab)](https://www.measurementlab.net/), the app measures download and upload speeds at scheduled intervals to the nearest M-Lab server.

> [!NOTE]
> Earlier versions of Giga Meter used the NDT-5 protocol. As of version 2.0+, all measurements use NDT-7.

**What it measures:**
- Download speed (Mbps)
- Upload speed (Mbps)
- Latency (ms)

## Ping Test

*Introduced in version 2.0.2, November 2025.*

The app runs a ping test every 15 minutes during school hours (8 AM–8 PM local time) to the nearest Cloudflare server.

**What it measures:**
- Whether the device has internet connectivity at that point in time
- **Uptime** — the percentage of successful ping responses over total test attempts on powered-on devices during school hours

## Measurement schedule

| Test type | Frequency | Window |
|---|---|---|
| **Speed test** | Up to 4 per day | First test within 15 min of device power-on; remaining tests in 3 time slots |
| **Ping test** | Every 15 minutes | 8 AM – 8 PM local time |
| **Manual test** | On demand | Any time |

**Speed test time slots** (based on system local time):

| Slot | Time |
|---|---|
| Morning | 8 AM – 12 PM |
| Afternoon | 12 PM – 4 PM |
| Evening | 4 PM – 8 PM |

> [!NOTE]
> Tests will not run if the device is switched off or on Sleep mode. For best results, keep the device on and connected to the school's internet throughout the day.

## Connectivity status on Giga Maps

Results from Giga Meter are used to classify school connectivity status on [Giga Maps](https://maps.giga.global/):

| Color | Status |
|---|---|
| 🟢 Green | Good connectivity (meets selected benchmark) |
| 🟡 Yellow | Moderate connectivity |
| 🔴 Red | Slow connectivity (below selected benchmark) |
| 🔵 Blue | No recent data |
